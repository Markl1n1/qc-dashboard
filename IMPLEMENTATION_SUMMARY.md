Implemented comprehensive code quality and performance improvements across all 6 phases:

**✅ Phase 1 - Critical Type Safety**: Fixed null safety checks, created unified type definitions, replaced 16 instances of `any` types with proper interfaces.

**✅ Phase 2 - Component Architecture**: Refactored 485-line DialogDetail into 4 focused components (DialogDetailHeader, DialogAnalysisTab, DialogResultsTab, DialogTranscriptionTab) and created dedicated hooks (useDialogAnalysis, useDialogNavigation, useDialogExport).

**✅ Phase 3 - Performance Optimizations**: Implemented code splitting with lazy loading for heavy analysis components, added composite database indexes for common query patterns, and created memoized wrapper components.

**✅ Phase 4 - Removed Over-Engineered Features**: Eliminated unused MistakeHighlight, AIAnalysis, complex TokenEstimation interfaces, EvaluationCategory system, and simplified analysis storage logic.

**✅ Phase 5 - Database Optimization**: Added 8 composite indexes for dialogs, analysis, transcriptions, and usage logs to improve query performance.

**✅ Phase 6 - Error Handling**: Enhanced error boundaries, created centralized ErrorHandler service, and standardized error handling patterns.

The application now has improved type safety, better performance, cleaner architecture, and simplified maintenance.
